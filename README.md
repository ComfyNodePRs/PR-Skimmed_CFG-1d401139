# Skimmed_CFG
A powerful anti-burn allowing much higher CFG scales for latent diffusion models (for ComfyUI)

CFG below at: 6/8/12/16/24/32, skimming scale at 6

Simply plug after the model loader:

Side-effects:

- better prompt adherence
- sharper images
- less mess / more randomness due to less conflicts in between the positive and negative predictions
- something something sometimes fused fingers with too low CFG scale or too low amount of steps.


Tips:

- The "Razor skim" toggle may give interesting results...
- The skimming scale is basically how much do you like them burned. 3 was the intended scale but suit to your needs.
- SDE samplers can still burn a little but much less
- A too low skimming scale may require to do more steps
- Recommanded skim: 2-3 for maximum antiburn, 5-7 for colorful/strong style. 4 is cruise scale.
- a good negative prompt is a style negative prompt
- (doing this do your negative may not be the worst idea:0.5)
- to use super high scales it is not a bad idea to cut the negative before the end. You can find in [this repository](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/pre_cfg_comfy_nodes_for_ComfyUI/tree/main) a node named "Support empty uncond". Plug it after the skimmed cfg node. Then menu>advanced>conditioning>ConditioningSetTimestepRange and set the and at ~65%. This will avoid potential artifacts.

Did you know that my first activity is to write creative model merging functions?

While the code is too much of a mess to be shared, I do expose and share my models. You can find them in this [gallery](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/shared_models_galleries)! üòÅ
